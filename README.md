# **Personal Portfolio Milestone Project**
This website is a professional portfolio to present my skills and background to future employers and colleagues. My page opens up to introduce me â€“ who I am, what my goals are, and shares an image so site users can put a friendly face to my name. The portfolio includes an about me section which introduces my education, work experience, and technical skills in a clear, clean format. This section also includes a link to my resume. The overall goal of this site is to introduce my skills and goals to future employers for easy browsing and showcasing of my abilities.

## Author
Stephen Seither

## UX
This project implemented a variety of skill sets to enhance the end user experience. The author's own understanding of both HTML and CSS were accompanied with Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript CDNs to further enhance the design of the end product. Additionally, FontAwesome and CloudFlare were employed for minor design features. The end goal of the user design was to serve as a showcase and test of the author's abilities and understanding of the technologies and libraries of information that a developer would need to use when creating a website in a busniess setting. 

### User Stories
1. As a recruiter, I want to learn more about the background, experience, and skill set of the potential candidate. 
2. As a candidate, my mission is to present myself, my skills, and my goals in an easy to understand manner which inspires confidence in potential employers.
3. As a site user, I want the site to be easy and intuitive to navigate as well as visually appealing.

## Features
1. <strong>About Me</strong> - This is the landing page for my website. There are many relevant pieces of information on this page including a brief overview of my personality, history, and aspirations.

2. <strong>Resume</strong> - This page of my website gives the viewer a more thorough and in-depth view of three important aspects of my abilities. The first two sections are built as their own individual timelines to give the viewer an easy to look at and clear understanding of both my work history and my educational journey. The last section on this page includes a list of some of my hard and soft skills.  

3. <strong>Portfolio</strong> -  This page is broken up into two distinct sections. The first section includes a thumbnail of various projects that I have worked on in my time as a developer. Each of these thumbnails is linked to the specific project that it is meant to represent. The second section includes progress bars which showcase some of my programming abilities and my self-evaluated proficiency in each category. 

4. <strong>Contact Me</strong> - This last page of my website is mainly dedicated to a way for others to contact me with whatever they would like to send my way. It includes a contact form with fields for relevant information I would need in order to converse with someone visiting my site.
 
## Features Left to Implement
There are a few features left to implement on my site. So far, they include:
